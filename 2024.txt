Mobile (Andriod):

This is Geometry Dash version 2.2, which adds even more to Geometry Dash like update 2.1 did. Here are the features:

1. Editor: There are many more triggers and features in the editor.
  1-1. Show Hitboxes: This shows all of the hitboxes for the objects in the editor. However, the Big Beast object's hitbox doesn't show, most likely because the image itself is the hitbox.
    1-1-1. Colors: The color list is: Retro blue for collidable objects, retro red for objects that make the player die, retro green for objects that can be activated, or aqua for objects the player can jump through then land on.
    1-1-2. This setting can also be activated in the settings in the main menu (Show hitboxes in Practice), or when playing a lavel then clicking pause, then clicking on the settings button.
  1-2. Modes: These modes customize how the player goes through the level.
    1-2-1. Classic: The player travels through the level, like in 1.0 - 2.2. The player travels at a linear rate, it's speed depending on which speed portal the player touches.
    1-2-2. Platformer: The p[layer can go any left/right direction they choose, unlike 2.1 <= (earlier than/equal to 2.1). The player moves at a speed depending on which speed portal the player touches.

      1-4-1-6. Page 2: This is the page 2 directory for this trigger.
        1-4-1-6-1. Start: The default setting is set to 0, meaning the sound's progress (in milliseconds) starts without skipping anything.
        1-4-1-6-2. End: The default setting is set to 0, meaning the sound does not end when the sound's progress (in milliseconds) exceeds this value.
        1-4-1-6-3. Fade in: The default setting is set to 0, meaning the sound does not fade in at the start (in milliseconds).

This doesn't provide ALL of the features in Geometry Dash, but there are still most that aren't being listed in this documentation.
